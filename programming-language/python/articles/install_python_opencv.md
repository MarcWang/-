Open up a terminal and update the apt-get  package manager followed by upgrading any pre-installed packages:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Now we need to install our developer tools:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git pkg-config
```

OpenCV needs to be able to load various image file formats from disk, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc. In order to load these image formats from disk, weâ€™ll need our image I/O packages:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev
```

GTK development library
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
```

processing video streams and accessing individual frames
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev
```

Install libraries that are used to optimize various routines inside of OpenCV:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran
```
